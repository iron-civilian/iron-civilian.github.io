<p>We study motility-induced phase separation behavior of RTPs in 2D. We look at the percolation properties of clusters formed 
and characterize the critical behavior. We obeserve a continuous variation in exponents which we explain through the Super-universality Hypothesis. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11726" target="_blank">(arxiv)</a> <a href="https://github.com/iron-civilian/Percolation_RTPs" target="_blank">(code)</a>

<p>We study a semi-conserved version of the Ashkin-Teller Model. The non-conserved counterpart is known to exhibit a magnetic and polarization transition at the same critical point, whose location is a function of the inter-layer coupling &lambda;. We study magnetic and percolation transition in the conserved one and compare the critical behavior with the non-conserved version.

<p>We study the effect of non-reciprocity in the classical Ising Model. We modify the ordinary Ising model to incorporate non-reciprocal
interactions. We study several cases present in the literature and show that despite the novel phase behavior induced by non-reciprocity, it fails to modify the critical behavior of the magnetization transition.
